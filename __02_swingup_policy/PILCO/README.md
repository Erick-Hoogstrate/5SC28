# Folder overview

- The files in examples-connect-to-exp are used to connect to the setup using matlab.
- From matlab-simulator the functions that represent the unbalanced disk in matlab are used to train PILCO.
- Multitarget contains all files that where used to attempt to create a single policy for multiple targets.
- pilcoV09 contains all PILCO files.
- Swing up contains the files for training and loading the swing up policy on the simulator and the setup. (The setup code partially works, but could not be further tested due to time constraints.)
