## Model_encoder
This folder contains the model trained. This is used for prediction and simulation.

## Hand-in.ipynb
This contains the code for the prediction file. 
To retrain the model, change False into True in the if statement. To run the code the deepSI toolbox needs to be installed. To get the correct output for the submission file I had to loop trough each input/output set as the deepSI toolbox did not accept the provided data. 

## Hand-in-simulation.ipynb
This contains the code for the simulation file.
To retrain the model, change False into True in the if statement. To run the code the deepSI toolbox needs to be installed.
